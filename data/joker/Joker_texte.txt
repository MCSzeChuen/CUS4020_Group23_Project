Joker	ACT I	1	SCENE I	1	1	NARRATION	NARRATION	"INT. DEPT. OF HEALTH, OFFICE - MORNING"	
Joker	ACT I	1	SCENE I	1	2	NARRATION	NARRATION	"CLOSE ON JOKER (30's), tears in his eyes from laughing so hard. He's trying to get it under control. His greasy, black hair is matted down. He's wearing an old, faded red hooded zip-up sweatshirt, a threadbare gray scarf, thin from years of use, hangs loosely around his neck.

WE NOTICE TWO FADED OLD SCARS cut at the corners of his mouth. Almost forming a smile.

He's sitting across from an overworked SOCIAL WORKER (50's), African American. Her office is cramped and run-down in a cramped and run-down building. Stacks of folders piled high in front of her.

She just sits behind her desk, waiting for his laughing fit to end, she's been through this before. Finally it subsides.

Joker takes a deep breath, pauses to see if it's over.

Beat."

How 'bout you. How's the job? Still enjoying it?"	
Joker	ACT I	1	SCENE I	1	6	JOKER	JOKER	"Yeah, I   mean, it's different each day, so  I really like that. I don't think I   could ever work in an office.   Behind a desk."

Joker	ACT I	1	SCENE 2	2	8	NARRATION	NARRATION	"She smiles. Writes something down. Looks at the clock, she's running late for her next appointment."

Joker	ACT I	1	SCENE 2	2	17	JOKER	JOKER	"I've been using it as a journal, but also a joke diary. Funny thoughts or, or observations-- Did I tell you I'm pursuing a career in stand-up comedy?"
