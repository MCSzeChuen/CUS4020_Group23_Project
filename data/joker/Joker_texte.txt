Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE I	1	1	NARRATION	NARRATION	"INT. DEPT. OF HEALTH, OFFICE - MORNING"	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE I	1	2	NARRATION	NARRATION	"CLOSE ON JOKER (30's), tears in his eyes from laughing so hard. He's trying to get it under control. His greasy, black hair is matted down. He's wearing an old, faded red hooded zip-up sweatshirt, a threadbare gray scarf, thin from years of use, hangs loosely around his neck.
WE NOTICE TWO FADED OLD SCARS cut at the corners of his mouth. Almost forming a smile.
He's sitting across from an overworked SOCIAL WORKER (50's), African American. Her office is cramped and run-down in a cramped and run-down building. Stacks of folders piled high in front of her.
She just sits behind her desk, waiting for his laughing fit to end, she's been through this before. Finally it subsides.
Joker takes a deep breath, pauses to see if it's over."	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE I	1	3	JOKER	JOKER	#NAME?	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE I	1	4	NARRATION	NARRATION	"Despite the laughter, there's real pain in his eyes.
Something broken in him. Looks like he hasn't slept in days."	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE I	1	5	SOCIAL WORKER	SOCIAL WORKER	"It's certainly tense. People are upset, they're struggling. Looking for work. The garbage strike seems like it's been going on forever. These are tough times.
(then)
How 'bout you. How's the job? Still enjoying it?"	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE I	1	6	JOKER	JOKER	"Yeah, I   mean, it's different each day, so  I really like that. I don't think I   could ever work in an office.   Behind a desk."	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 2	2	7	JOKER	JOKER	No offense.	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 2	2	8	NARRATION	NARRATION	"She smiles. Writes something down. Looks at the clock, she's running late for her next appointment."	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 2	2	9	SOCIAL WORKER	SOCIAL WORKER	Have you been keeping up with your journal?	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 2	2	10	JOKER	JOKER	Everyday.	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 2	2	11	SOCIAL WORKER	SOCIAL WORKER	Great. Did you bring it with you?	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 2	2	12	JOKER	JOKER	"(dodging the subject)
I'm sorry. Did I bring what?"	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 2	2	13	SOCIAL WORKER	SOCIAL WORKER	"(impatient; she doesn't have time for this)
Arthur, last time I asked you to bring your journal with you. For these appointments. Do you have it?"	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 2	2	14	JOKER	JOKER	Yes ma'am.	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 2	2	15	SOCIAL WORKER	SOCIAL WORKER	Can I see it?	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 2	2	16	NARRATION	NARRATION	He reluctantly reaches into his bag. Pulls out a weathered notebook. Slides it across to her--	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 2	2	17	JOKER	JOKER	"I've been using it as a journal, but also a joke diary. Funny thoughts or, or observations-- Did I tell you I'm pursuing a career in stand-up comedy?"	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 2	2	18	NARRATION	NARRATION	She's half-listening as she flips through his journal.	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 2	2	19	SOCIAL WORKER	SOCIAL WORKER	No. You didn't.	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 2	2	20	JOKER	JOKER	I think I did.	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 3	3	21	NARRATION	NARRATION	"She doesn't respond, keeps flipping through his journal--"	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 3	3	22	SOCIAL WORKER	SOCIAL WORKER	"Oh yeah. Because of what your mother said,-- about your purpose. ""To bring laughter and joy to the world,"" right?"	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 3	3	23	JOKER	JOKER	Right.	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 3	3	24	NARRATION	NARRATION	"ANGLE ON JOURNAL, pages and pages of notes, all in neat, angry-looking handwriting. Also, cut out photos from hardcore pornographic magazines and some crude handmade drawings.
A flash of anger crosses Joker's face. We see him picking at his right eyebrow, almost obsessively. Trying to stay calm. His eyebrow is actually half-gone. Something he does a lot."	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 3	3	25	JOKER	JOKER	I didn't realize you wanted to read it.	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 3	3	26	NARRATION	NARRATION	"The social worker gives him a look, then reads something in the pages that gives her pause."	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 3	3	27	SOCIAL WORKER	SOCIAL WORKER	"(reading out loud)
""I just hope my death makes more sense than my life."""	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 3	3	28	NARRATION	NARRATION	"She looks up at Joker. He just stares back. Lets it hang out there for a beat.
Then he laughs a little, even though he doesn't think it's funny--"	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 3	3	29	JOKER	JOKER	"Yeah. I mean, that's just--"	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 3	3	30	SOCIAL WORKER	SOCIAL WORKER	Does my reading it upset you?	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 3	3	31	NARRATION	NARRATION	He leans in.	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 3	3	32	JOKER	JOKER	"No. I just,-- some of it's personal. You know?"	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 3	3	33	SOCIAL WORKER	SOCIAL WORKER	I understand. I just want to make sure you're keeping up with it.	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 3	3	34	NARRATION	NARRATION	She slides his journal back to him. He holds it in his lap.	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 4	4	35	SOCIAL WORKER	SOCIAL WORKER	What about your mom? How's she feeling?	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 4	4	36	JOKER	JOKER	She has good days. But mostly bad. It's been a big help having me there. She really needs me.	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 4	4	37	SOCIAL WORKER	SOCIAL WORKER	Seems like she's been sick a lot since you got home.	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 4	4	38	JOKER	JOKER	"(nods)
Yeah, it's good I'm there. When I was in the hospital, after my last episode-- she was having trouble getting over there to visit."	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 4	4	39	NARRATION	NARRATION	"She looks back up at the clock, she needs to get to her next
appointment."	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 4	4	40	SOCIAL WORKER	SOCIAL WORKER	"All right. So, I'll see you again, two weeks from today?"	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 4	4	41	NARRATION	NARRATION	"He nods. But keeps sitting there for a moment.
She stands up, trying to signal it's time for him to leave--"	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 4	4	42	SOCIAL WORKER	SOCIAL WORKER	"Is there something else I can help you with, Arthur? My next appointment is waiting."	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 4	4	43	NARRATION	NARRATION	He just keeps sitting there.	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 4	4	44	JOKER	JOKER	"Yeah, I was wondering if you could ask the doctor to increase the dosage on my medications? Nothing seems to make a difference."	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 4	4	45	SOCIAL WORKER	SOCIAL WORKER	"(looking over his record)
Do you know which ones you'd like increased?"	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 4	4	46	NARRATION	NARRATION	"Shakes his head, no."	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 4	4	47	SOCIAL WORKER	SOCIAL WORKER	Have you been sleeping?

Some."	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 5	5	49	NARRATION	NARRATION	She glances at his file again.	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 5	5	50	SOCIAL WORKER	SOCIAL WORKER	"Arthur, you're on seven different medications. Surely they must be doing something."	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 5	5	51	NARRATION	NARRATION	"He finally stands up. Zips up his faded red sweatshirt.
Looks at her--"	
Joker	ACT 1	1	SCENE 5	5	52	JOKER	JOKER	I just don't wanna feel so bad anymore.	
Joker	ACT 2	2	SCENE 6	6	53	NARRATION	NARRATION	"EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE, MIDTOWN - KENNY'S MUSIC SHOP - DAY"	
Joker	ACT 2	2	SCENE 6	6	54	NARRATION	NARRATION	"GOTHAM SQUARE IS CLOGGED WITH TRAFFIC. Non-stop honking horns, pedestrians crowding the sidewalk. Huge billboards, giant movie marquees, garbage bags piled high everywhere. Underneath it all we hear a TINKLING PIANO playing something bouncy and fast-paced.
FROM ACROSS THE BUSY CITY STREET, we see Joker. He's dressed as a sad-faced HOBO CLOWN. This is his job.
Dressed in tattered clothes, dark five o'clock shadow painted on his face, big bulbous red nose, his mouth's outlined in white, turned down at the corners.
He's holding up a sign in front of Kenny's Music Shop that reads, ""EVERYTHING MUST GO!"" A banner above the store reads, ""GOING OUT OF BUSINESS!"" Behind him, an OLD MAN plays a piano on the street. Both of them there to draw attention to the big sale going on in the store.
Joker's doing a little Charlie Chaplin like waddle to the music. Most people walk right past, ignoring him. A few bump into him by mistake.
JOKER SEES A GROUP OF FIVE BOYS, no more than 15-years-old, walking toward him. He moves out of their way. They crack up laughing when they see him. Start making fun of him."	
Joker	ACT 2	2	SCENE 6	6	55	NARRATION	NARRATION	"Joker ignores them, tries to do his job the best he can while maintaining some dignity. Keeps dancing and holding up the sign.
One of the kids knocks the sign out of Joker's hands--"	
Joker	ACT 2	2	SCENE 6	6	56	KID #1	KID #1	"Suck my dick, clown."	
Joker	ACT 2	2	SCENE 6	6	57	NARRATION	NARRATION	"The kids laugh. Joker doesn't say anything. Just bends over to pick up the sign--
Another kid kicks him in the ass--"	
Joker	ACT 2	2	SCENE 6	6	58	KID #2	KID #2	Whoops.	
Joker	ACT 2	2	SCENE 6	6	59	NARRATION	NARRATION	"Joker falls face first onto the sidewalk. Oddly, the old man playing the piano picks up the pace of the music--
The kids crack up. One of the boys grabs Joker's sign and takes off running across the street--
The other kids follow, weaving through traffic--
Joker gets up and gives chase. He needs his sign back.
He almost gets hit by a taxi, spinning out of the way just in time-- Spinning right into another taxi that stops just short of hitting him.
Joker keeps running through traffic. People stare. A clown barreling down the street has got to be a joke--"	
Joker	ACT 3	3	SCENE 6	6	60	NARRATION	NARRATION	"EXT. CORNER, SIDE STREET - GOTHAM SQUARE - CONTINUOUS"	
Joker	ACT 3	3	SCENE 6	6	61	NARRATION	NARRATION	"The five boys are booking it down the crowded street laughing and whooping it up. At the last second they take a sharp right turn down a cross street--
Joker almost overshoots the corner, slip-sliding in his big red shoes--
He rights himself and heads down after them--
Sees them running up ahead--
WHAP! Out of nowhere Joker gets hit in the face!
He falls to the ground.
One of the kids was hiding between parked cars and hit Joker with the ""EVERYTHING MUST GO!"" sign, splintering it in two--"	
Joker	ACT 3	3	SCENE 7	7	62	NARRATION	NARRATION	"The other kids turn back and walk up to Joker down on the ground.
Joker reaches out, still trying to save the sign--
THE KIDS START KICKING AND BEATING THE SHIT out of Joker. It's brutal and vicious. Nobody on the street stops to help.
CLOSE ON JOKER'S HOBO CLOWN FACE, down on the ground. Sweat running down his face, smearing his make-up. He doesn't even look like he's in pain. He just takes the beating.
That stupid frown painted on his face."	
Joker	ACT 4	4	SCENE 7	7	63	NARRATION	NARRATION	INT. CITY BUS (PULLING OUT) - HEADING DOWNTOWN - DUSK	
Joker	ACT 4	4	SCENE 7	7	64	NARRATION	NARRATION	"Joker, makes his way toward the back of the crowded bus, now walking with a slight limp, but keeping his head held high.
His make-up's washed off, costume and props all shoved into a big shopping bag slung over his shoulder. Some white grease-paint still smudged on the sides of his face.
He finds an empty seat in the back of the bus. Sees a sad- eyed FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL, face puffy from crying, sitting on her knees looking back at him. Her mother's facing forward, but even from behind you can tell she's angry.
Joker sees the sad-eyed girl staring straight back at him. He doesn't know where to look, feeling self-conscious and small. He gets back into ""character"" smiling like a clown and covers his face with his hands-- Starts playing the peek-a-boo game with her.
The girl stares back at him for a moment then giggles--"	
Joker	ACT 4	4	SCENE 7	7	65	WOMAN ON BUS	WOMAN ON BUS	"(turns back to Joker; already annoyed)
Can you please stop bothering my kid?"	
Joker	ACT 4	4	SCENE 7	7	66	JOKER	JOKER	"I wasn't bothering her, I was--"	
Joker	ACT 4	4	SCENE 7	7	67	WOMAN ON BUS	WOMAN ON BUS	"(interrupts)
Just stop."	
Joker	ACT 4	4	SCENE 7	7	68	NARRATION	NARRATION	"AND SUDDENLY JOKER STARTS TO LAUGH. LOUD. He covers his mouth trying to hide it-- Shakes his head, laughter pausing for a moment, but then it comes on stronger. His eyes are sad. It actually looks like the laughter causes him pain."
