ALADDIN	THE COMPLETE SCRIPT
PEDDLER	Oh I come from a land
JAFAR	You...are late.
GAZEEM	"A thousand apologies, O patient one."
JAFAR	"You have it, then?"
GAZEEM	I had to slit a few throats to get it.  (Pulls out
JAFAR	"Trust me, my pungent friend.  You'll get what's"
IAGO	What's coming to you!  Awk!
JAFAR	"Quickly, follow the trail!"
JAFAR	"At last, after all my years of searching,  the cave"
IAGO	Awk!  Cave of wonders!
GAZEEM	By Allah!
JAFAR	"Now, remember!  Bring me the lamp.  The rest of the"
IAGO	"Awk, the lamp!  Awk,  the lamp!  (Now that IAGO and"
CAVE	Who disturbs my slumber?
GAZEEM	"It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief."
CAVE	Know this.  Only one may enter here.  One whose
JAFAR	What are you waiting for?  Go on!
CAVE	"Seek thee out, the diamond in the rough."
IAGO	I can't believe it.  I just don't believe it. We're
JAFAR	"Patience, Iago.  Patience.  Gazeem was obviously"
IAGO	"(Extremely sarcastically) Oh, there's a big"
JAFAR	"Yes, we do.  Only one may enter.  I must find this"
GUARD	"Stop, thief!  I'll have your hands for a trophy,"
ALADDIN	"(Looks back, then down, then at the bread.)  All"
ALADDIN	You think that was easy?
ALADDIN	"Morning, ladies."
ALADDIN	Trouble?  No way.  You're only in trouble if you
ALADDIN	I'm in trouble!
GUARD	"...and this time--(A screeching sound from ABU,"
ALADDIN	"Perfect timing, Abu!"
ABU	Hello!
ALADDIN	"Come on, let's get outta here!"
GUARDS	(one at a time) Riffraff! Street rat!
ALADDIN	"Just a little snack, guys!"
GUARDS	"Rip him open, take it back guys!"
ALADDIN	"I can take a hint, gotta face the facts"
WOMEN	Who?!?
WOMAN	"I'd blame parents, except he hasn't got 'em!"
ALADDIN	"Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat"
CROWD	"Stop, thief! Vandal!"
ALADDIN	Let's not be too hasty
LADY	Still I think he's rather tasty
GUARDS	WRONG!
ALADDIN	One jump ahead of the hoofbeats!
CROWD	Vandal!
ALADDIN	One hop ahead of the hump!
CROWD	Street rat!
ALADDIN	One trick ahead of disaster
CROWD	Scoundrel!
ALADDIN	They're quick--but I'm much faster
CROWD	Take that!
ALADDIN	"Here goes, better throw my hand in"
ALADDIN	"And now, esteemed effendi, we feast!  All right!"
ABU	Uh-oh!
ALADDIN	"Here, go on--take it."
ABU	"Ah, don't.  Huh?"
PRINCE	"Out of my way, you filthy brat!"
ALADDIN	"Hey, if I were as rich as you, I could afford some manners"
PRINCE	Oh--I teach you some manners!
ALADDIN	"Look at that, Abu.  It's not every day you see a"
PRINCE	You are a worthless street rat.  You were born a
ALADDIN	I'm not worthless.  And I don't have fleas.  Come
ALADDIN	"Riffraff, street rat."
PRINCE	I've never been so insulted!
SULTAN	"Oh, Prince Achmed.  You're not leaving so soon, are"
PRINCE	Good luck marrying her off!
SULTAN	"Oh, Jasmine!  Jasmine!  Jasmine!  (The SULTAN goes"
JASMINE	"Oh, father.  Rajah was just playing with him,"
SULTAN	"Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor"
BOTH	...must be married to a prince.
SULTAN	By your next birthday.
JASMINE	The law is wrong.
SULTAN	You've only got three more days!
JASMINE	"Father,  I hate being forced into this.  (She takes"
SULTAN	"Jasmine, it's not only this law.  (She hands him"
JASMINE	Try to understand.  I've never done a thing on my
SULTAN	"But Jasmine, you're a princess."
JASMINE	Then maybe I don't want to be a princess.  (She
SULTAN	Oooohhh!  Allah forbid you should have any
SULTAN	I don't know where she gets it from.  Her mother
JAFAR	"My life is but to serve you, my lord.  (He bows.)"
SULTAN	It's this suitor business.  Jasmine refuses to
IAGO	(In the parrot voice) Awk!  Wit's-end.
SULTAN	"Oh, ha ha.  Have a cracker, pretty polly!  (He"
JAFAR	Your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals.
SULTAN	"If anyone can help, it's you."
JAFAR	"Ah, but it would require the use of the mystic blue"
SULTAN	"Uh, my ring?  But it's been in the family for"
JAFAR	It is necessary to find the princess a suitor.
SULTAN	Everything...will be...fine.
JAFAR	The diamond.
SULTAN	"Here, Jafar. Whatever you need will be fine."
JAFAR	"You are most gracious, my liege.  Now run along and"
SULTAN	(Still hypnotized)  Yes...that'll be...pretty good.
IAGO	I can't take it anymore!  If I gotta choke down on
JAFAR	"Calm yourself, Iago."
IAGO	Then I'd grab him around the head.  Whack! Whack!
JAFAR	"(Speaking over IAGO.)  Soon, I will be sultan, not"
IAGO	And then I stuff the crackers down his throat!  Ha
JASMINE	"Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.  But I can't stay here and"
ALADDIN	"Okay, Abu.  Go!"
PROPRIETOR	"(To passing crowd)  Try this, your taste buds"
ABU	Blah blah blah!
PROPRIETOR	"Why, you!  Get away from here, you filthy ape!"
ABU	Bye bye!
ALADDIN	Nice goin' Abu.  Breakfast is served.
JASMINE	"I don't think so.  (She backs away, but bumps into"
ALADDIN	(He's obviously deeply in love with her.)  Wow!
ABU	Uh oh.  Hello?  Hello?
JASMINE	"Oh, you must be hungry.  Here you go.  (The"
PROPRIETOR	You'd better be able to pay for that.
JASMINE	(Mystified) Pay?
PROPRIETOR	No one steals from my cart!
JASMINE	"Oh, I'm sorry sir.  I don't have any money."
PROPRIETOR	Thief!
JASMINE	"Please, if you let me go to the palace, I can"
PROPRIETOR	Do you know what the penalty is for stealing?
JASMINE	"No, no please!"
ALADDIN	Thank you kind sir.  I'm so glad you've found
JASMINE	(whispering) What are you doing?
ALADDIN	(whispering back) Just play along.
PROPRIETOR	You know this girl?
JASMINE	"Sadly, yes.  She is my sister.  She's a little"
PROPRIETOR	She said she knows the Sultan!
ALADDIN	She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.
JASMINE	"Oh, wise Sultan.  How may I serve you?"
ABU	"Well, blah blah blah blah."
ALADDIN	"Tragic, isn't it?  (He leans forward, picking"
JASMINE	"(To a camel standing nearby) Oh, hello doctor."
ALADDIN	"No, no, no. Not that one. (To ABU, whose"
PROPRIETOR	Huh?  What is it?  (ABU picks up what he can
IAGO	"(huffing and puffing)  With all due respect, your"
JAFAR	"Save your breath, Iago.  Faster!  (He places the"
IAGO	"Yes, o mighty evil one."
JAFAR	"Ah, sands of time--reveal to me the one who can"
IAGO	That's him?!?!   That's the clown we've been
JAFAR	Let's have the guards extend him an invitation to
IAGO	Swell.
ALADDIN	Almost there.
JASMINE	I want to thank you for stopping that man.
ALADDIN	"Uh, forget it.  (He grabs a pole.)  So, uh, this is"
JASMINE	Is it that obvious?
ALADDIN	"Well, you do kinda stand out.  (He stares at her,"
JASMINE	I'm a fast learner.
ALADDIN	"Right.  C'mon, this way.  (They go inside the roof"
JASMINE	Is this where you live?
ALADDIN	Yep.  Just me and Abu.  Come and go as we please.
JASMINE	Fabulous.
ALADDIN	"Well, it's not much, (he pulls back the curtain and"
JASMINE	"Oh, it's wonderful."
ALADDIN	"I wonder what it would be like to live there, to"
JASMINE	"Oh, sure.   People who tell you where to go and how"
ALADDIN	It's better than here.  Always scraping for food
JASMINE	You're not free to make your own choices.
ALADDIN	Sometimes you feel so--
JASMINE	You're just--
BOTH	(in unison) --trapped.
ALADDIN	"So, where're you from?"
JASMINE	"What does it matter?  I ran away, and I am not"
ALADDIN	Really?  (He takes a bite from the apple in his
ABU	Why you!
JASMINE	My father's forcing me to get married.
ALADDIN	That's--that's awful.  (ABU appears from behind the
JASMINE	What?
ALADDIN	Abu says that--uh--that's not fair.
JASMINE	Oh did he?
ALADDIN	"Yeah, of course."
JASMINE	And does Abu have anything else to say?
ALADDIN	"Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do"
ABU	"Oh, boy!"
JASMINE	"Hmm, tell him that's very sweet."
GUARD	Here you are!
JASMINE	They've found me!  (To each other) They're
JASMINE	My father must have sent them--
ALADDIN	Do you trust me?
ALADDIN	Do you trust me? (He extends his hand)
JASMINE	Yes. (She takes it.)
ALADDIN	Then jump!
GUARD	"We just keep running into each other, don't we,"
GUARD	"It's the dungeon for you, boy."
ALADDIN	"Hey, get off of me!"
JASMINE	Let go of him.
GUARD	(Not realizing she is the princess) Look what we
JASMINE	(standing up and pulling off the hood of her cloak)
GUARD	Princess Jasmine.
ALADDIN	The princess?
ABU	(peeking out from the vase) The princess?
GUARD	What are you doing outside the palace?  And with
JASMINE	That's not your concern.  Do as I command.  Release
GUARD	"Well, I would, princess, but my orders come from"
JASMINE	"(getting a very pissed-off look) Believe me, I"
JASMINE	Jafar?
JAFAR	"Oh, uh, princess."
IAGO	"Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck!"
JAFAR	How may I be of service to you? (He spreads out his
JASMINE	"The guards just took a boy from the market, on your"
JAFAR	Your father's charged me with keeping peace in
JASMINE	What was the crime?
IAGO	"I can't breathe, Jafar!"
JAFAR	"Why, kidnapping the princess, of course."
IAGO	If you could just--(JAFAR kicks him back inside the
JASMINE	He didn't kidnap me! I ran away!
JAFAR	"(Walking away as if shocked) Oh, dear!  Oh, why"
JASMINE	What do you mean?
JAFAR	"Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried"
JASMINE	What sentence?
JAFAR	(with a sinister tone)  Death.  (JASMINE gasps.)
JASMINE	No!  (She collapses to the floor.)
JAFAR	"I am exceedingly sorry, princess."
JASMINE	How could you?  (She runs from the room crying.)
IAGO	"So, how did  it go?"
JAFAR	I think she took it rather well.  (They both get a
JASMINE	"It's all my fault, Rajah.  I didn't even know his"
ALADDIN	(to himself) She was the princess.  I don't believe
ABU	(from a distance) Yoo-hoo!  Aladdin? Hello!
ALADDIN	"Abu!  Down here!  Hey, c'mon--help me outta these."
ALADDIN	"Hey, she was in trouble.  Ah, she was worth it."
ABU	"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
ALADDIN	"Don't worry, Abu.  I'll never see her again.  I'm a"
ABU	Ta da!
ALADDIN	(Rubbing his wrists) I'm a--I'm a fool
OLD MAN	"You're only a fool if you give up, boy."
ALADDIN	Who are you?
OLD MAN	"A lowly prisoner, like yourself.  But together,"
ALADDIN	I'm listening.
OLD MAN	"There is a cave, boy.  A cave of wonders.  Filled"
IAGO	"Jafar, can ya hurry it up?  I'm dyin' in here!"
ALADDIN	But the law says that only a prince can marry--
OLD MAN	"You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you boy?"
ALADDIN	So why would you share all of this wonderful
OLD MAN	I need a young man with strong legs and a strong
ALADDIN	"Ah, one problem.  It's out there, we're in here?"
OLD MAN	"Mmm, mmm, mmm.,  Things aren't always what they"
ABU	"Oh, hmm."
ALADDIN	"It is I, Aladdin."
CAVE	Proceed.  Touch nothing but the lamp.
OLD MAN	"Remember, boy--first fetch me the lamp, and then"
ALADDIN	"C'mon, Abu.  (to ABU hiding under the shoulder of"
ALADDIN	Would ya look at that!
ABU	Uh oh!
ALADDIN	Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer
ALADDIN	Abu!
ALADDIN	Don't...touch...anything!  We gotta find that lamp.
ABU	Huh?
ABU	Aladdin!  Aladdin!
ALADDIN	"Abu, will ya knock it off?"
ALADDIN	"Abu, what are you--crazy?"
ALADDIN	A magic carpet!  C'mon.  C'mon out.  I'm not gonna
ALADDIN	"Take it easy, Abu.  He's not gonna bite."
ALADDIN	"Hey, wait a minute.  Don't go.  Maybe you can help"
ALADDIN	Wait here!
ABU	Oh.  Huh?
ALADDIN	This is it?  This is what we came all the way down
CAVE VOICE	Infidels!
CAVE VOICE	You have touched the forbidden treasure.  (ABU
ALADDIN	"Whoa!  Carpet, let's move!"
ALADDIN	"Abu, this is no time to panic!  (He pulls ABU off"
ALADDIN	Help me out!
OLD MAN	Throw me the lamp!
ALADDIN	I can't hold on.  Give me your hand.
OLD MAN	First give me the lamp!
OLD MAN	Ha ha ha ha!  Yes!  At last!  Ha ha ha ha!
ALADDIN	What are you doing?
OLD MAN	Giving you your reward.  (JAFAR returns to his
JAFAR	Heh heh heh! It's mine.  It's all mine! I (He can't
SULTAN	"Jasmine?  Oh, dearest.  What's wrong?"
JASMINE	Jafar...has...done something... terrible.  (She
SULTAN	"There, there, there, my child--we'll set it right."
ABU	"Oh, oh. Aladdin?  Wake up.  Aladdin."
ALADDIN	"Oh, my head. (He looks at the entrance sealed in.)"
ABU	Aha!
ALADDIN	"Why, you hairy little thief!  Looks like such a"
GENIE	Aaaaahhhhh!  OY!  Ten-thousand years will give ya
ALADDIN	"Uh, Al--uh--Aladdin."
GENIE	(Says his name as if he's discovered something
ALADDIN	(Shaking his head) I must have hit my head harder
GENIE	(Still a dog) Do you smoke?  Mind if I do? (Dog
ALADDIN	Wait a minute!  I'm--your master?
GENIE	(Slaps a diploma in ALADDIN's hand and a
GENIES	"Duplicated, duplicated,  duplicated,"
GENIE	(Says it like a ring announcer at a boxing match.)
ALADDIN	Whoa!  Wish fulfillment?
GENIE	Three wishes to be exact.  And ix-nay on the
ALADDIN	(To ABU) Now I know I'm dreaming.
GENIE	"(Music for ""Friend Like Me"" begins) Master, I don't"
GENIE	"So what'll it be, master?"
ALADDIN	You're gonna grant me any three wishes I want?
GENIE	"(As William F. Buckley) Ah, almost.  There are a"
ALADDIN	Like?
GENIE	"Ah, rule number one:     I can't kill anybody.  (He"
ALADDIN	"(Looks at ABU as if plotting) Ah, provisos?  You"
GENIE	Excuse me?  Are you lookin' at
SULTAN	"Jafar, this is an outrage.  If it weren't for all"
JAFAR	"I assure you, your highness, it won't happen again."
SULTAN	"Jasmine, Jafar, now let's put this whole messy"
JAFAR	My most abject and humblest apologies to you as
JASMINE	At least some good will come of my being forced to
SULTAN	"That's nice.  All settled, then.  Now, Jasmine,"
JAFAR	If only I had gotten that lamp!
IAGO	(As JASMINE) I will have the power to get rid of
JAFAR	"No, Iago.  Only until she finds a chump husband."
BOTH	Eeewww!
IAGO	(Has an idea) Oh!  Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
JAFAR	(He looks at IAGO in insult)  What?
IAGO	"Okay, you marry the princess,all right? Then, uh,"
JAFAR	Oh!Marry the shrew?  I become sultan.  The idea has
IAGO	"Yes, merit! Yes!  And then we drop papa-in-law and"
JAFAR	"Iago, I love the way your foul little mind works!"
GENIE	(Still as stewardess) Thank you for choosing Magic
ALADDIN	"Oh, you sure showed me.  Now about my three wishes-"
GENIE	Dost mine ears deceive me?  Three? You are down by
ALADDIN	"Ah, no--I never actually wished to get out of the"
GENIE	"Well, don't I feel just sheepish?  All right, you"
ALADDIN	"Fair deal.  So, three wishes.  I want them to be"
GENIE	"Me?  No one's ever asked me that before. Well, in"
ALADDIN	"What?  No, tell me."
GENIE	Freedom.
ALADDIN	You're a prisoner?
GENIE	"It's all part-and-parcel, the whole genie gig."
ALADDIN	"Genie, that's terrible."
GENIE	"(Comes out of the LAMP) But, oh--to be free.  Not"
ALADDIN	Why not?
GENIE	The only way I get outta this is if my master
ALADDIN	I'll do it. I'll set you free.
GENIE	(Head turns into Pinocchio's with a long nose) Uh
ALADDIN	"No, really, I promise.  (He pushes the nose back in"
GENIE	"Well, here's hopin'.  (Shakes ALADDIN's hand.)"
ALADDIN	"Well, there's this girl--"
GENIE	"Eehhh! (Like a buzzer, and GENIE's chest shows a"
ALADDIN	"Oh, but Genie.  She's smart and fun and..."
GENIE	Pretty?
ALADDIN	Beautiful.  She's got these eyes that just...and
GENIE	(Sitting in a Parisian cafe with ABU and CARPET.)
ALADDIN	"But she's the princess.  To even have a chance, I'd"
GENIE	"Let's see here.  (Has a ""Royal Cookbook"".) Uh,"
ALADDIN	"Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince!"
GENIE	All right!  Woof woof woof woof! (Takes on square
GENIE	"Here he comes, (ALADDIN and GENIE are on a game"
ALADDIN	"Abu, you look good."
GENIE	"He's got the outfit, he's got the elephant, but"
JAFAR	"Sire, I have found a solution to the problem with"
IAGO	Awk!  The problem with your daughter!
SULTAN	"Oh, really?"
JAFAR	"(Unrolling a scroll) Right here.  ""If the princess"
SULTAN	But Jasmine hated all those suitors!  (He tries to
JAFAR	"Not to worry, my liege.  There is more.  If, in the"
SULTAN	What?  Who?
JAFAR	"The royal vizier!  Why, that would be...me!"
SULTAN	"Why, I thought the law says that only a prince can"
JAFAR	"Desperate times call for desperate measures, my"
SULTAN	Yes...desperate measures...
JAFAR	You will order the princess to marry me.
SULTAN	I...will order...the princess...to...(the spell
JAFAR	(Holds the staff closer) The princess will marry
SULTAN	The princess will marry...(the spell is again

SWORDSMEN	Say hey!  It's Prince Ali!

SULTAN	Prince Ali Ababwa!  Of course.  I'm delighted to
JAFAR	"(Extremely dryly) Ecstatic.  I'm afraid, Prince"
ALADDIN	--Ababwa!
JAFAR	Whatever.  You cannot just parade in here uninvited
SULTAN	"...by Allah, this is quite a remarkable device."
ALADDIN	"Why certainly, your majesty.  Allow me."
JAFAR	"Sire, I must advise against this--"
SULTAN	#NAME?
JAFAR	Just where did you say you were from?
ALADDIN	"Oh, much farther than you've traveled, I'm sure."
JAFAR	Try me.  (IAGO lands on the staff.)
SULTAN	"Look out, Polly!"
IAGO	"Hey, watch it. Watch it with the dumb rug!"
SULTAN	"Out of the way, I'm coming in to land.  Jafar,"
JAFAR	"Spectacular, your highness."
SULTAN	"Ooh, lovely.  Yes, I do seem to have a knack for"
JAFAR	"I don't trust him, sire."
SULTAN	"Nonsense.  One thing I pride myself on Jafar, I'm"
IAGO	"Oh, excellent judge, yeah, sure...not!!!"
SULTAN	Jasmine will like this one!
ALADDIN	And I'm pretty sure I'll like Princess Jasmine!
JAFAR	"Your highness, no.  I must intercede on Jasmine's"
ALADDIN	"Your majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! (He pricks"
JASMINE	How dare you!  (They all look at her surprised.)
SULTAN	"Oh, dear.  Don't worry, Prince Ali.  Just give"
JAFAR	I think it's time to say good bye to Prince
ALADDIN	What am I going to do?  Jasmine won't even let me
GENIE	"(to carpet, playing chess) So move!  (CARPET does,"
ALADDIN	"Genie, I need help."
GENIE	"(as Jack Nicholson) All right, sparky, here's the"
GENIE	"(Back to normal, wearing a mortarboard. He points"
ALADDIN	No way!  If Jasmine found out I was really some
GENIE	A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh!
ALADDIN	"Hey, that's the last thing I want to  be.  Okay,"
GENIE	(Sadly) Like a prince.
ALADDIN	(From a distance) Princess Jasmine?
JASMINE	Who's there?
ALADDIN	It's me--Prince Ali.  Ahem--(Then he jumps to his
JASMINE	I do not want to see you.
ALADDIN	"No, no, please princess.  Give me a chance. (RAJAH"
JAFAR	Just leave me alone.
ALADDIN	Down kitty!
GENIE	How's our beau doing?
ALADDIN	"Good kitty, take off.  Down kitty. (He takes off"
JASMINE	(She looks at him thinking she has seen him
ALADDIN	"(Quickly replaces his turban) Uh, no, no."
JASMINE	You remind me of someone I met in  the marketplace.
ALADDIN	The marketplace?  (A bee buzzes around his head.)
JASMINE	"(She looks disappointed.)  No, I guess not."
BEE	"(It's the GENIE) Enough about you, Casanova.  Talk"
ALADDIN	"Um, Princess Jasmine?  You're very..."
BEE	"Wonderful, glorious, magnificent, punctual!"
ALADDIN	Punctual!
JASMINE	Punctual?
BEE	Sorry.
ALADDIN	Beautiful.
BEE	Nice recovery.
JASMINE	"Hmm.  I'm rich too, you know."
ALADDIN	Yeah!
JASMINE	The daughter of a sultan
ALADDIN	I know.
JASMINE	A fine prize for any  prince to marry.
ALADDIN	"Uh, right.  Right.  A prince like me."
BEE	(Buzzing in his ear) Warning! Warning!
JASMINE	"Right, a prince like you.  And every other stuffed  shirt,"
BEE	"(Rear end on fire, wearing goggles and crashing) Mayday!"
JASMINE	Just go jump off a balcony! (She turns and walks away)
BEE	Stop her! Stop her! Do you want me to sting her?
ALADDIN	(Swats at bee) Buzz off!
BEE	"Okay, fine.  But remember--bee yourself! (BEE buzzes into"
ALADDIN	"Yeah, right!"
JASMINE	What!?!
ALADDIN	"Uh, you're right.  You aren't just some prize to be"
JASMINE	No!
ALADDIN	(Pokes his head up from over the edge) What?  What?
JASMINE	(Now she's amazed) How--how are you doing that?
ALADDIN	It's a magic carpet.
JASMINE	It's lovely.  (CARPET takes JASMINE's hand with a
ALADDIN	"You, uh, you don't want to go for a ride, do you?"
JASMINE	Is it safe?
ALADDIN	Sure.  Do you trust me?
JASMINE	(She looks at him at the saying of that all-
ALADDIN	(Extends his hand the same as before) Do you trust
JASMINE	(Gets a sly grin on her face) Yes.
ALADDIN	I can show you the world
JASMINE	A whole new world
ALADDIN	Now I'm in a whole new world with you!
JASMINE	Unbelievable sights
JASMINE	A whole new world!
ALADDIN	Don't you dare close your eyes
JASMINE	An hundred thousand things to see
ALADDIN	Hold your breath--it gets better!
JASMINE	"I'm like a shooting star,"
JASMINE	Every turn a surprise
ALADDIN	With new horizons to pursue
JASMINE	"Every moment, red-letter"
BOTH	I'll chase them anywhere
ALADDIN	A thrilling chase
JASMINE	A wondrous place
BOTH	For you and me!
JASMINE	It's all so magical.
ALADDIN	Yeah.
JASMINE	(She looks at him and decides to burst the bubble)
ALADDIN	Nah.  He hates fireworks.  (CARPET looks up
JASMINE	(She pulls off his turban) You are the boy from the
ALADDIN	"Jasmine, I'm sorry."
JASMINE	Did you think I was stupid?
JASMINE	That I wouldn't figure it out?
ALADDIN	"No.  I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.  No, that's not"
JASMINE	Who are you?  Tell me the truth!
ALADDIN	"The truth? (He looks at CARPET who wave him on,"
JASMINE	Why didn't you just tell me?
ALADDIN	"Well, you know, um...royalty going out into the"
JASMINE	Not that strange.
JASMINE	"Good night, my handsome prince."
ALADDIN	"Sleep well, princess."
ALADDIN	"Yes!  (He falls back onto the CARPET, who descends"
ALADDIN	Hey!  What?  (A gag is tied around his mouth.
GUARD	Hold him!

JAFAR	"There's a new order now--my order!  Finally, you"

IAGO	Why am I not surprised?
JAFAR	"If you will not bow before a sultan, then you will"
IAGO	"Ladies and gentlemen, a warm Agrabah welcome for"

ALADDIN	(off-camera) Jafar!  Get your hands off her!
JAFAR	Prince Ali

GENIE	"Al!  Al, little buddy!"
ALADDIN	Shh!

JAFAR	"Things are unraveling fast, now boy. (CARPET is"
ALADDIN	"Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly"
JAFAR	"A snake, am I?  Perhaps you'd like to see how"
GENIE	"Rickem, rockem, rackem, rake--stick that sword into"

GENIE	"Me too, Al.  No matter what anybody says, you'll"
SULTAN	That's right.  You've certainly proven your worth
JASMINE	Father?
SULTAN	"Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?  From this day"
